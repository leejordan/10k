Hillary was raised in a suburb of Illinois where she attended public school and was raised a Methodist by her parents. She attended Wellesley College, and went on to study law at Yale. After attending Yale Law School, she went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After serving as a lawyer for the Congressional Committee investigating President Nixon, she moved to Arkansas where she taught law and ran legal clinics representing poor people. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, one of the state’s first child advocacy groups. As First Lady under President Bill Clinton, Hillary tenaciously led the fight to reform our health care system so that all our families have access to the care they need at affordable prices. Hillary led the U.S. delegation to Beijing to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women and gave a groundbreaking speech, declaring that “human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all”—inspiring women worldwide and helping to galvanize a global movement for women’s rights and opportunities. Hillary was then elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first woman senator from New York.  She repeatedly worked across the aisle to get things done, including working alongside Republicans after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When Congress wouldn't do enough for rural areas and small towns, Hillary didn’t back down. She launched innovative partnerships with the tech industry and provided support to local colleges and small businesses. When President Obama asked Hillary to serve as his secretary of state, she answered the call to public service once again. She was a forceful champion for human rights, internet freedom, and rights and opportunities for women and girls, LGBT people and young people all around the globe. Now she’s running for President because everyday Americans need a champion and she wants to be that champion.\n\nABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON YOUTUBE CHANNEL\nWelcome to Hillary Clinton’s YouTube Channel.

Workers at Dartmoor Zoo have been running around with pink blankets draped over them in the hope of getting Vladimir the big cat to budge. The wacky tactic is aimed at luring the Siberian tiger into a temporary pen while a pond is dug in his main enclosure. Royal Marines have volunteered to dig the pond and give Vladimir a place to cool down. Zoo staff have tried everything to get him out including offering meat and throwing large balls. But Vladimir has twigged that something is afoot and has so far refused to move with a stand off already lasted several hours.",

Workers at Dartmoor Zoo have been running around with pink blankets draped over them in the hope of getting Vladimir the big cat to budge. The wacky tactic is aimed at luring the Siberian tiger into a temporary pen while a pond is dug in his main enclosure. Royal Marines have volunteered to dig the pond and give Vladimir a place to cool down. Zoo staff have tried everything to get him out including offering meat and throwing large balls. But Vladimir has twigged that something is afoot and has so far refused to move with a stand off already lasted several hours."

But the reasons are often left a little vague.\nIt isn’t that we crudely want entertainment – there are enough comedians on TV. We don’t just want a laugh. We want to find a way to be annoyed with, and criticise one another’s most maddening sides without eliciting a drama, with lightness and a special kind of diplomatic immunity…”\nYou can read more about the Curriculum and other topics on our blog TheBookofLife.org: http://bit.ly/2bXUpGC  \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife  \n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nAna Tortos\nhttp://www.anatortos.com/",

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!\"",

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!\""

The clip starts with a side by side comparison with Original Vantablack and Vantablack S-VIS all against a conventional black painted strip of steel. The two new versions have different total hemispherical reflectances (THR), as one is designed to be lower cost than the other. The best has a THR of 0.5% (vis spectrum) and the lower cost version has a THR of 0.8% (vis spectrum). When you compare this against conventional, black coatings, or even the hex coating seen in the clips, you can see that they out perform even the best and most expensive super-blacks available today (other than Vantablack and S-VIS). Both can be handled, but greasy fingers will damage the optical trapping cavities. \n\nPlease note that these products are still in development and are not ready for release.",

            "description": "The way to a healthy mind is through the stomach, according to psychiatrist Drew Ramsey. The right foods can decrease your risk of depression by 50%, and treat clinical mental disorders. Ramsey's latest book is \"Eat Complete:  The 21 Nutrients That Fuel Brainpower, Boost Weight Loss, and Transform Your Health\" (http://goo.gl/GSyJqj).\n\nRead more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/drew-ramsey-on-diet-and-depression\n\nFollow Big Think here:\nYouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthink\n\nTranscript - For about ten years we've had very strong correlational data showing that, for example, when you eat poorly your risk of depression and illnesses like depression just go up 70/80 percent. And when you eat a more traditional diet like a Mediterranean diet or Japanese diet your risk of an illness like depression can go down by as much as 50 percent. And so that's now led to the first clinical trial that is just being reported showing that a Mediterranean diet augmented with some red meat actually can treat clinical depression, major depression disorder. And it's a very exciting moment for nutritional psychiatry. It's a time when we have more science that tells us food should really be part of the conversation when it comes to our mental health. We are facing an incredible mental health academic. I've been in New York as a psychiatrist now for 16 years and the amount of distress and the amount of mortality that we're seeing is like levels we've never seen before and we need as many tools in our toolbox and food is very much there, both from just common sense. We all know that to feel right we need to eat right, but then also backed up by now an incredible amount of science showing that a core set of nutrients actually have very clear data that can help in the prevention and the treatment of illnesses, again, like depression and dementia. So we want to encourage people to eat those foods that have most of these nutrients and then help them do that is really part of a mental health care plan.\n\nWe think about a lot of illnesses when we eat, heart disease, cancer, diabetes and it's always struck me that really the illness you should be worried about or the organ you should be worried about when you're eating is your brain because that is by far your biggest asset. It consumes more of your energy in your food than any other organ you have. And so focusing on the nutrients your brain needs guide you to a slightly different set of foods that if you focus on just things like calories or saturated fat or preventing something like cancer. And so it's an exciting moment as the data begins to catch up with common sense. Read Full Transcript Here: http://goo.gl/ZKYdOU.",

It is quite big, absolutely beautiful.  The holes in the cave are known as moulins, from which dripping water carved the cavern years ago.  It is located near Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon and Skaftafell in South Iceland, at the base of Svinafellsjokull Glacier.  The cave is difficult to access by normal car and only accessible in the cold of winter while the risks of collapse are lower.\n\nAlso check out Crystalapse: Wonders of Iceland\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIQqVqQs9Xs",

It is quite big, absolutely beautiful.  The holes in the cave are known as moulins, from which dripping water carved the cavern years ago.  It is located near Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon and Skaftafell in South Iceland, at the base of Svinafellsjokull Glacier.  The cave is difficult to access by normal car and only accessible in the cold of winter while the risks of collapse are lower.\n\nAlso check out Crystalapse: Wonders of Iceland\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIQqVqQs9Xs"

Footage of the set shows Electronica encouraging fans to bypass security and stand alongside him, and naturally, the crowd followed his instructions, swarming Elec only moments after his request. \n\n“Let’s try to collapse this motherfucking stage. Let’s try to tear this bitch down,\" Jay can be heard saying. \"If you're scared stay down there. If you're not scared, come up here with me.”\n\nOver one thousand people made their way to the stage, causing police to intervene after security became overwhelmed. No arrests were made.\n\nOne fan account from the Philadelphia Inquirer suggests that Elec's decision to bring the crowd on stage was an attempt to maintain their attention after some fans spotted Philly's own Lil Uzi Vert walking by.",

Footage of the set shows Electronica encouraging fans to bypass security and stand alongside him, and naturally, the crowd followed his instructions, swarming Elec only moments after his request. \n\n“Let’s try to collapse this motherfucking stage. Let’s try to tear this bitch down,\" Jay can be heard saying. \"If you're scared stay down there. If you're not scared, come up here with me.”\n\nOver one thousand people made their way to the stage, causing police to intervene after security became overwhelmed. No arrests were made.\n\nOne fan account from the Philadelphia Inquirer suggests that Elec's decision to bring the crowd on stage was an attempt to maintain their attention after some fans spotted Philly's own Lil Uzi Vert walking by."
